# Roman-ESOLANG-
**ROMAN** IS AN *ESOTERIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE* THAT USES ROMAN NUMERALS AS A CHARACTER.
REMEMBER THE ROMAN NUMERALS? IF SO, GO TO LINE 36.

IF YOU DON'T KNOW, HERE IS THE TIP:

    1.)I : 1
    2.)V : 5
    3.)X : 10
    4.)L : 50
    5.)C : 100
    6.)D : 500
    7.)M : 1000
    8.)IV : 4
    9.)IX : 9
    10.)XL : 40
    11.)XC : 90
    12.)CD : 400
    13.)CM : 900

TAKE THE NUMBER IN EXPANDED FORM AND REPLACE IT WITH ROMAN NUMERALS

**EXAMPLES**

> 6  => 5 + 1 => V + I => VI

> 14 => 10 + 4 => X + IV => XIV

> 999 => 900 + 90 + 9 => CM + XC + IX => CMXCIX

` NOTE THAT IIII, VVVV, XXXX, LLLL, CCCC, DDDD, MMMM, IIIII, VVVVV, ETC. STILL WORKS IN THE CODE. HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T COUNT AS A ROMAN NUMERALS. `

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

BEFORE YOU BEGIN THE CODE, PLS PUT THE SOURCE FILE INTO YOUR CODE FOLDER WITH A ROMAN FILE(OR WHATEVER IT IS) OR IN AN EXAMPLE FOLDER.
THE CODE USES SYS' ARGV LIST(INDEX 0) FOR THE TERMINAL. SO THE CODE WILL WORK.
TO START USING THE LANGUAGE, RUN MAIN.PY BECAUSE ITS THE REAL TERMINAL.
PRINTING A STRING OR AN INTEGER IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THIS CODE, INSTEAD, PRINT A CHARACTER.
YOU KNOW THAT EVERY CHARACTER HAS AN ASCII NUMBER,

>     (A -> 65)

IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS OF AN ASCII CHARACTER, LOOK AT THE ASCII TABLE.
TO PRINT A CHARACTER, YOU MUST START WITH A COLON (:)

>     (:CHAR)

NEXT TO IT, PUT A ROMAN NUMBER OF AN ASCII CHARACTER NUMBER. NO SPACES BETWEEN THE COLON AND THE ROMAN NUMERALS.
[IF A IS 65, THEN ITS NUMERAL IS LXV]

>     (:LXV)

CAPITAL LETTERS ARE ONLY ALLOWED FROM THE NUMERALS.
COMMENTS ARE ALLOWED. JUST DONT PUT A COLON AT THE START OF EACH COMMENT

>     (THIS IS A COMMENT)

EXAMPLE OF THE STRING *"ABC"*:

> ABC SAMPLE

>> :LXV

>> :LXVI

>> :LXVII

***NOTE(IMPORTANT): FILE EXTENSION FOR THIS LANGUAGE IS "rn".***

*HAVE FUN!* :wink:
